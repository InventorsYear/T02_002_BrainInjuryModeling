    "## 2 Why this is useful\n",
    "Safety is, on one hand, an important set of practices that must be followed and kept in mind during laboratory work. However, another view is to consider safety as a vital area of technical design. Here we take this latter view and focus on using physics as a basis for the design of equipment that protects people from head injuries. We will see that this is an opportunity to apply Newton's second law, the kinematics of one-dimensional accerated motion, and a first-level of understanding of mass-spring systems in this extremely important context. We live in a state - Colorado - that is known for all of its opportunities for an active life-style. With outdoor sports like cycling, skiing, rock-climbing, kayaking, etc. there is a broad need for protective head gear. Recent news stories describe serious long-term consequences of head trauma in professional, collegiate, and pre-college sports, where the seriousness is compounded by the fact that participants are in the early years of what should be healthy and happy lives. We see in the following that objective and quantitative approaches to modeling head-trauma and designing safety equipment is not only highly enriched by fundamental physics but is intellectually accessible to people who can directly benefit from such work."

    "IMPORTANT NOTE: this lab consists of modeling of injury and therefore might seem frightening. If you have experienced a traumatic injury or otherwise have cause to be upset by the topic of this lab, please discuss an alternative exercise with the instructor. There is no need to do this lab if it creates discomfort.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab consists of the following actions and ideas:\n",
    "- Carry out a set of experiments that tests a model of possible sudden impact on a head if a person falls off of a bicycle. The model is very simple: an empty soft drink bottle is the skull, a folded stripp of paper towel is tissue supporting the brain, and a AA batter is the brain itself. In the experiments, you will first measure the static breaking strength of a srip of paper towel holding the battery mass representing the brain. Then you wil find critical height from which dropping the model \"skull,tissue, and brain\" just causes rupture of the tissue. \n",
    "- The two key take-away points of understanding are:\n",
    "    - that sudden impact causes very strong forces to occur.\n",
    "    - experimentally, there are uncertainties in the process of measurement that must be assessed to place limits on how well we know quantities such as breaking strength and critical height.\n",
    "\n",
    "OPTIONAL Here are additional things to do that would let you achieve a richer understanding:\n",
    "- OPTIONAL Complete a short series of introductory exercises reviewing one-dimensional motion and writing a short code to calculate times of free falls from various heights.\n",
    "- OPTIONAL Carefully study the models of the collision that lead to a calculation of an effective colision time and a spring-constant representing the stretching of the tissue connecting the brain to the skull.\n",
    "- OPTIONAL Use the data to estimate values of the collision time and spring constant.\n",
    "- OPTIONAL Conduct further drop tests using one, two, and three layers of identical soft paddding and see how this affects the critical height.\n",
    "- OPTIONAL Implement a design intervention that reduces the hazard of injury from sudden impact to the head."

In particular, we will see what sort of impacts cause the battery - the \"brain mass\" - to tear the tissue of the towel. Of course, the actual physiology of injury to the brain during sudden impacts is much more complex. We aim to use this simplified picture to first gain insights into how physical quantities inolved in the collision - such as the collision force and acceleration, the height of a damaging fall, the velocity just before impact, and the duration of the collision - are related. These insights will then suggest  ways to design protective gear that will prevent damage from occuring.\n",

    "Note that we are intentionally using simple apparatus. We aim to show that a lot of insight into important problems can be obtained by first working with simple models and clever use of basic physical objects. Later, more sophisticated apparatus - such as an accelerometer, a force plate, and computer-aided data acquisition - can be used for more refined experiments. These, in turn, can be used to develop more sophisticated models."
